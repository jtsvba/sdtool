# Service Desk Tool
This tool simplifies the process of finding the corresponding Vestiging when searching for a customer, as well as finding the corresponding shiftrunner in that particular Vestiging. 

# How-to use the tool
1. Navigate to MS Teams > 1e Lijnst Support > General > Files
2. Select Klantenoverzicht + SDT.xlsm and <b>open in app</b> (It is very important that you do it this way).
3. Make sure that macro's are allowed by pressing "Inhoud activeren/Enable content"
4. Press the start button on the SD Tool sheet.
5. Have fun. 

# Shortcuts
- Alt + Z = Zoeken
- Alt + A = Annuleren
- Alt + V = Velden legen
- Alt + E = Email versturen
- Alt + W = Wijzigingsmodus

# How-to change data
Changes to the data (e.g. KC, TC) are only possible on the Klanten sheet and not on the individual vestiging sheets. 
Therefore these changes need to be made on that sheet. All other information such as opmerkingen and derde partijen can be filled in on your vestiging-specific sheet. 

The file must be openend in app at all times!
