# Service Desk Tool
This tool simplifies the process of finding the corresponding Vestiging when searching for a customer, as well as finding the corresponding shiftrunner in that particular Vestiging. 

# How-to use the tool
1. Navigate to MS Teams > General > Files
2. Select SD Tool.xlsm and <b>open in app</b>
3. Make sure that macro's are allowed.
4. Press the start button on the SD Tool sheet.
5. Have fun. 


# How-to change data
Changes to the data (e.g. KC, TC) is only possible on the Klanten sheet and not on the individual vestiging sheets. 
Therefore these changes need to be made on that sheet. All other information such as opmerkingen and derde partijen can be filled in on your vestiging-specific sheet.
